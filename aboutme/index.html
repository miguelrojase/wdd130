    <p>Hi All, I am from Santiago, Chile. I am 40 years old, I have been married for 16 years to my beautiful wife
        Cynthia. We have 3 children, ages 15, 12 and 7. I love my family and I like spending time with them. When Iâ€™m
        not at work or serving in my church calling I like to watch sports and to read. I have been a member of The
        Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints all of my life. I am a Mechanical Engineer. I studied at the
        University of Santiago de Chile. I have been working in a company called Vorwerk for 13 years. My actual
        position is Manager of Cash Processing area. In this company, we are dedicated to delivering solutions related
        to the processing of banknotes and coins. My main responsibility is to know the needs of our customers and solve
        those needs through our solutions and machines.

    <p>I am currently working on Web Frontend Certificate (Applied Technology BS). I chose this certificate because I
        always loved Technology and Internet, for me this is an opportunity to learn new skills that will serve me in my
        actual job. I really love the opportunity to study online at BYU-I it is a great blessing to study with people from different parts of the world.
